  swim active                                  Show currently active vimrc
  swim mv <alias1> <alias2>                    Rename alias
  swim rm <alias>                              Delete an alias entirely

  swim help                                    Show this message


Example:
  swim add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dawsonbotsford/swim/master/exampleVimrcs/vimrcWikia.vim example
  swim ls                    Show available swim aliases
  swim with example          Set ~/.swim/example.vim as primary .vimrc
  swim with main             Set ~/.swim/main.vim as primary .vimrc


Setup:
  On install, you will have the \"main\" swim alias. Add alternate vimrc aliases with \"swim add <URLToRaw or pathToFile>  <alias>\"
  Then use \"swim with <alias\" to change your active vimrc file.
